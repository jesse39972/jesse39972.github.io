# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence tools have started to make waves in various fields, from art to writing. I believe that AI has no place in any of these fields. My stance remains unchanged when it comes to education and software engineering. Besides messing with Bard for 5 minutes because I had to for this essay’s requirements, I have not made use of any AI tools over the course of this semester, and I have no plans on changing that. 


# Personal Experience

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
I did not make use of any AI tools for any of these WODs. There were a plethora of resources available to help, such as the write-ups in each module, screencasts, and even documentation. I hardly ever needed outside help, and the few times I did, I preferred to search for the information on my own, whether through reading messages in the discord or surfing the web. I believe this problem-solving process helps build and improve valuable intuition skills.

2.In-class Practice WODs
Once again, for reasons very similar to the ones listed above, I did not utilize any AI tools. However, these WODs typically involved working with others, and a lot of the students I worked with used AI, resulting in a situation where I had second-hand usage. I did not find the AI solutions helpful. Oftentimes, the AI solution became very convoluted and involved working through many unnecessary steps and concepts for a simple problem. 

3. In-class WODs
Once again, I did not use AI tools. The in-class WODs were very similar to both the experience and practice ones. I did not need outside help. Even if I forgot something, I tried to recall the information on my own as active retrieval is an important part of the learning process. 

4. Essays
Writing is a skill that I take pride in, and a process that I greatly enjoy. Being a mostly creative endeavor, this is one of the fields that I believe AI truly has no place in. Therefore, it goes without saying that I did not use AI in any essays. You can always stand to improve in your writing, and I do not plan to miss any opportunity for such growth.   
Final project
I have no plans to use AI for the final project. However, many of my group members are doing so. I do appreciate how quickly the AI can get things done, as I am at the point of the semester where I am burnt out. I notice the problem described in number 2, where AI can make simple problems needlessly complex. Working through this layer of added complexity may prove challenging.  
Learning a concept / tutorial
I have not used any AI tools here. I much prefer to learn things the old fashioned way. I believe that the standard process of trial and error builds valuable skills that come in handy in many areas of life. 
Answering a question in class or in Discord
I have not used any AI tools here. If I do not know the answer to a question, I simply do not say anything. If it’s an area I’m interested in or I want to help the other person, I will google it and look for an answer. 
Asking or answering a smart-question
I have not used any AI tools here. Whenever I ask a question, I often know exactly what I want to ask and see no need to pass my thoughts through an arbitrary filter. I can’t see generating questions to be something you need AI for. 
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
No AI here. A lot of the needed coding examples can be found in the modules and documentation. 
Explaining code
No AI here. I try to trace tasks that I don’t understand, and I usually end up figuring out how it works from there. 
Writing code
If you count the autofill in IntelliJ, then I use AI all the time here. The time saved from not having to manually type everything out is immense. If you do not count it, then no AI is used. 
Documenting code
No AI used here. I also do not do this manually either though. 
Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
There is a button in IntelliJ that fixes all the eslint errors automatically. Is that considered AI? If so, then I use it all the time. If not, then no. 
Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I can’t think of any personal use cases, but I did have group members generate mockup images for final project web pages. I found the results to be pretty entertaining. 



# Standards.

While they can seem pointless and a little tedious, learning to work with coding standards pays dividends down the line. Writing more easily readable code is never a bad thing, and leveraging your tools in the correct way can eliminate any tedium involved in combing through a file for errors. Only good can come from incorporating standards into your code sooner rather than later.
