 I've never been into programming, or software, or any of that stuff, but I've always enjoyed math and solving puzzles. As I got older, I realized I needed to find some sort of career or skill to pursue. Random retail and restaurant jobs were killing my soul. I decided to go back to college, and after taking a few courses to ease back into it, decided on a whim to enter the computer science program, with the logic being that I could work on game design, as I had always loved video games. I ended up thoroughly enjoying programming. Every time you get something to run, it feels just like solving a puzzle. However, I had never programmed in my life. I decided to rely on some concepts I was familiar with.  
 
 In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly popular, and one of the core components of any mobile game is the daily quest, or “dailies”. Dailies involve the player doing a set of simple, individual tasks for a small reward. By themselves, each task seems insignificant. However, after doing all of them, you’ll find that you’ve spent a significant amount of time playing the game. Likewise, the reward given may seem small, but after a while, it starts to add up. 

While originally designed as a way to improve player retention and profits, I find this to be an effective approach to general learning. Just like Rome, learning cannot be done in a single day. A learned skill/concept/anything is the sum of daily practice over the course of months/years/decades. Do something every day, no matter how small that someting may be, and you'll find that it starts to add up. 

I am still working on keeping this concept in mind. There are days where I don't feel like doing anything, no matter how small. There are other days where I feel I need to do everyting in one day because I am not progressing fast enough. I plan to use this course not only to learn new concepts about software engineering and programming but also to improve my mindset. With the quick pace, I will be forced to work on coursework every day. With the difficulty, I will be forced to slow it down and ensure understanding before moving on. If I just do my dailies, I'm sure I'll be fine.
