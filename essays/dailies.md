 In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly popular, and one of the core components of any mobile game is the daily quest, or “dailies”. Dailies involve the player doing a set of simple, individual tasks for a small reward. By themselves, each task seems insignificant. However, after doing all of them, you’ll find that you’ve spent a significant amount of time playing the game. Likewise, the reward given may seem small, but after a while, it starts to add up. 

While originally designed as a way to improve player retention and profits, I find this to be an effective approach to general learning. Just like Rome, learning cannot be done in a single day. A learned skill/concept/anything is the sum of daily practice over the course of months/years/decades. Do something every day, no matter how small that someting may be, and you'll find that it starts to add up. 

I am still working on keeping this concept in mind. There are days where I don't feel like doing anything, no matter how small. There are days when I feel I need to do everyting in one day because I am not progressing fast enough. I plan to use this course not only to learn new concepts about software engineering and programming but also to improve my mindset. The pace will motivate me to at least work on something small every single day, while the difficutly can remind me to slow it down. If I just do my dailies, I'm sure I'll be fine.
