Manual web development without frameworks can prove fairly tedious, and it is not uncommon to have more than one CSS class with the exact same or similar code. Frameworks like Bootstrap 5 streamline the web development process by offering a simple way to gain access to a long list of pre-written CSS classes that can then be added on to any HTML element to modify its properties. 

Loading in those pre-written classes included with a Framework proves relatively straightforward. First, you connect the framework to your HTML file. I’m sure there are many ways to do this, but the way I’m most familiar with is using links in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. You can also load in a set of commonly-found website icons, such as a cart or magnifying glass and even your own CSS stylesheet. Once everything is connected to your HTML file, you’re ready to use frameworks! 

While they do require a decent understanding of both HTML and CSS to use properly, Frameworks can be easily added on to any HTML element to start modifying its properties and designing a webpage. For example, if you wish to center some text, you simply add `class="justify-content-center"` to the container holding the text. This is much easier than doing it manually by coming up with a class name for your text, opening up your CSS file, creating a code block for that class, and finally typing in `justify-content: center`. It makes creating a website much faster and less tedious. 

That being said, Frameworks are not without difficulties. The hard part comes from knowing exactly which classes are available to you and how they work. While I understand the basics like centering content or padding, I have no idea what framework classes like `aria-expanded` do or how things like carousels work. Luckily, Bootstrap 5 comes with a documentation website. Here’s a [link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) to it. The documentation page for each class offers a brief, simple explanation for how they work and even some sample code that is readily available to be copied and pasted. Documentation proves extremely helpful, and I use it all the time. 

While they may possess a bit of a learning curve in properly utilizing the provided classes, Frameworks more than make up for it by streamlining the web development process and improving productivity. I highly recommend anyone with even a slight interest in making web pages to learn how to use them.
