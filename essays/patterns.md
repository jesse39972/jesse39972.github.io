# Pattern Recognition:

Pattern recognition plays a massive role in learning. To illustrate this with a personal example, I’ll briefly talk about chess. Chess has been played by many people for a very long time. Past games are studied in depth, and certain positions come up time and time again. Players run through all the moves and variations possible in these positions, determining which moves lead to a winning position for white or black, and which color is more likely to end up winning. If, in your own game, you recognize one of these positions, you can make quick, winning moves with confidence and less thought, gaining an advantage over your opponent. Design patterns are this pattern recognition, but for software engineering. Knowledge of design patterns gives key insight into how to approach certain problems and allows you to select the correct pattern to make those solutions as easy as possible. This saves time and effort, allowing you to simply write more code and make a bigger, better product. 

# Finding patterns in HTML and CSS: 


In my own programming, as someone who’s first programming language was Java, I find myself drawn to factory and prototype design models and often find myself trying to emulate these in my work. My early exposure to concepts like polymorphism and inheritance makes me all too familiar with working with these models. To offer an example from this class, I found myself struggling with Javascript. The more functional approach, while engaging, was new to me. I still struggle with the functions inside of functions inside of even more functions located within the Meteor/React code we have been working with. On the other hand, once I became familiar with the syntax, HTML and CSS clicked well for me. A container giving its properties to other containers within it, giving a div a specific property in a CSS file to give all divs that property, these things all reminded me of design models I was familiar with. This helped me pick up and start working with the language much quicker than expected to make functional webpages and mockups. That is the power of design patterns.
