I’ve recently read Eric Raymond’s “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” guide and decided I needed an example of both smart questions and not so smart ones. I took to StackOverflow, everyone’s favorite place to ask questions about programming, in search of these examples.

Off the bat, I faced a challenge: how would I even try to find questions? Would it be as easy as going to the website and clicking the first link I found? How would I ensure that question actually got answered, let alone seen? The solution I came up with was to google a problem that I recently struggled with. Google would most likely show relatively popular links, and I already had a good understanding of the subject material. I decided to google the sentence “for loop not working,” after working with said loops a fair amount in the first week. I immediately found two prime examples.

# Exhibit A:

This reads as almost a textbook example of the “smart questions” described in Raymond’s guide. The asker gives off the impression that they have already done a fair amount of work in trying to solve the problem on their own, offers a brief explanation of the problem, and attaches a small snippet of relevant code. The asker’s tone indicates they are aware the problem is their own fault and are simply seeking whatever small amounts of guidance anyone can spare. Though the problem and fix are trivial (remove the semicolon after the for loop declaration), the asker gets rewarded for their good manners with civil behavior, many helpful well-written answers, and 7 upvotes. Now let’s take a look at the other side.  


# Exhibit B:

![The second example question.](../img/ExhibitB.jpg)

Immediately, the extremely long code block jumps out at the reader. Your brain already starts to tune out whatever the asker has to say. By giving them the benefit of the doubt and reading their questions, you realize they’ve done the complete opposite of exhibit A. They offer no explanation of the problem, simply stating their input and the fact that it doesn’t work as intended. They offer their own proposed solution to the problem. The tone makes it seem as if they spent a few minutes simply inputting different values before coming to stackoverflow. The overall tone of the question makes it seem as if they’ve done everything they possibly could, and for some reason it’s still not working. For their behavior, the asker was rewarded with 6 downvotes and a grand total of 2 extremely short answers.


Here’s a link to both [question 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4574020/java-for-loop-not-working) and [question 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20559670/for-loop-doesnt-work) so you can see them for yourself. 

In school, we are taught that there are “no stupid questions.” This rings completely true in a school setting; teachers are paid to teach and answer questions, so while applying these rules may allow you better help and the teacher less headache, you also may as well get your money’s worth and fire away about anything that confuses you. In a different environment, where the other person has no obligation to deal with you whatsoever, you may need to pick your words carefully to get the information you need. That’s where a guide like “How to ask Questions the Smart Way” comes in. I recommend giving it a read, and maybe coming back to this essay for the examples to make more sense.
