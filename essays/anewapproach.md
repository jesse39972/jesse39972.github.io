Unlike typical classes, ICS 314 involves reviewing material on your own before class, then using that material to solve a programming problem in class. This problem is referred to as a “WOD.” The term WOD, or “Workout of the Day,” comes from crossfit and essentially means exactly what it says. You spend time every day working at the skill you hope to improve at, be it swinging around on a pull-up bar like a chimpanzee or writing code. This approach affects many different aspects of the class, forcing you to adopt different strategies for studying, and while it can be fairly stressful, I think I prefer it to a normal class structure. 

 Daily problem solving has replaced the need to study and review notes, and this hands-on approach keeps me much more engaged. Practice WODs are given in the days leading up to class, and I’ve found myself looking forward to solving these problems. On the other hand, I often have to drag myself to open up the textbook for other courses. Solving practice WODs offers a much more concrete approach to learning, as opposed to reading sentences over and over hoping they stick. Your day-to-day performance also offers an accurate gauge of what you should be focusing on. 

A potential downside of the WOD would be the need to have your brain in peak state come class time. For someone like me who feels a little groggy anytime before 12pm, my brain is ill-equipped to handle large amounts of pressure at 10:30. Sleepiness can cause you to overlook small syntactic details(something programming is all about) and core concepts you may have learned over the course of the week. Ultimately though, this gripe has more to do with the class time than the actual class structure.

I plan to keep solving those daily WODs, and perhaps even attend the in-person practice WODs as well if a time slot changes around to fit my schedule. Classtime being used to scrutinize WODs and go over different approaches to solving them has been fairly helpful. Exposing yourself to different solutions can bolster your understanding of a problem, and even offer a fresh, promising perspective for solving a new one.
