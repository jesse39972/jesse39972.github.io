<h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing The Game</h1>
<p>The game operated using a simple text menu and random number generator. Played with 2 players, the game consisted of each player taking turns selecting a choice from the menu. If they elected to cast out a line, a random number was generated and checked to be within a range. If within the range, a fish was hooked. If not, nothing was caught. Upon catching the fish, another number was generated to determine the weight. At the end of the game, the player with the highest total fish weight wins. Inheritance and general Object-Oriented Programming mechanics were used for the different fish types and behavior.</p>

<h1 id="group-experience">Group Experience</h1>
<p>This project was my first introduction to building some sort of software in a group. Each person was responsible for building a different species of fish for the game. If one person didn’t do their share, the rest of the gorup had to pick it up or suffer a reduced grade. Luckily, my group and I all performed very well together. Three people can do much more much quicker than one person. It was also nice being able to look over each other’s code, understand it, and help each other out. Seeing the different ways people can tackle the same problem can often give you a fresh perspective on other, harder problems.</p>

<h1 id="source-code">Source Code</h1>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/jesse39972/fishinggamesource">repo</a> containing the game and the fish objects. The actual game code is named FishingGame.java. I was responsible for the Uhu family.</p>
