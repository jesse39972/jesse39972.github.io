summary: "I wanted to see how good I could get at Chess over the summer."
---

I've always had a passing interest in chess since I was young, but I never really bothered taking the time to actually learn it. With chess's recent rise in popularity, I decided to spend this summer actively trying to study the game to see how good I could get in a short period of time. I learned a tiny bit of everything: opening theory, middlegame strategy, and endgame technique. My elo started in the mid 700s and currently sits at 1226 on chess.com. Chess has altered my approach to problem solving and improved my creativity. Instead of simply taking an action and assessing what happens after, I try to work through the result before taking any action. Having to visualize multiple moves in advance helped improve my imagination. I'm also more mindful of others. In chess, one of the most important skills isn't being able to come up with your own plans, but to see what your opponent's plans are and react accordingly. I've noticed I subconsciously have started adopting this mindset in other things that I do. It was fun while it lasted, but with how this course has been going, I will be putting the chess improvement journey on hold for the time being.
