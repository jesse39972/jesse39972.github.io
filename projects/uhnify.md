# Results and Approach
I've always had a passing interest in chess since I was young, but I never really bothered taking the time to actually learn it. With chess's recent rise in popularity, I decided to spend this summer actively trying to study the game to see how good I could get in a short period of time. I utilized resources such as books and internet videos to learn a tiny bit of everything: opening theory, middlegame strategy, and endgame technique. My elo started in the low 800s and currently sits at 1226 on chess.com. 

# Learning
Chess has altered my approach to problem solving and improved my creativity. I find myself thinking ahead more often, as well as constantly reevaluating options to look for a better solution. Surprisingly, one of the main benefits of chess has been making me more conscious of others. In chess, it is often more important to figure out what your opponent is doing and how you can influence their plan than it is to continue doing your own plan. I find myself adopting this way of thinking more and more in my day to day life. After experiencing the courseload for this class, the chess project will be put on an indefinite hold for the near future.
