summary: "Me and two other people coded a text-based fishing game in Java for our ICS 211 final project."

Our fishing game consisted of a series of fish objects utilizing inheritance. A text based menu is showed to the user where they can choose to cast a line or not. A random number generator was used to decide the outcome. Doing this taught me a lot about working with people.
